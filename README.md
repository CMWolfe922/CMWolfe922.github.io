# Software Projects 
### By: Charles M. Wolfe

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/CMWolfe922/CMWolfe922.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

### Current Projects:

[__market-data__](https://github.com/CMWolfe922/market-data) --> This is a side project of my own that I started to learn how to interact with an API to download price history data as well as fundamental data. As of now I can scrape the internet for every stock symbol in a given exchange and store it into a MySQL database. It will then select every symbol in the database (over 20 thousand) and retrieve the last 10 days 1-minute data. It also has the options to change the query params from minutes, to days to years.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/CMWolfe922/CMWolfe922.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
